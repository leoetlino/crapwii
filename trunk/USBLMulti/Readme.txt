It's too late... no long descriptions... it's the same with Waninkoko's
0.4 usb loader except you can easily make it multi language...
I provided support for Turkish in this...

If you have a strange language like Turkish without a proper internalization
support, then you need to change the console_font_8x16.c and recompile ogc 
library. Poor me changed it bit by bit calculating in the source file since 
I couldn't found a proper Turkish font file....

Next time...
