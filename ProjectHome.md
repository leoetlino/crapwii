## Crap is an easy to use channel creator for wii games. ##

**So in what ways does this app differ from similar applications?**

1. First of all it's the first configurable channel creator...

2. Unlike similar programs Crap has all it's features natively implemented. It doesn't invokes command line programs.. So it's not a mere gui.

3. Because of above difference, Crap is way a lot faster than it's counterparts.

4. It has a banner sanity check for banner bricks which other programs doesn't have. Though it's still recommended to have means of banner unbricking before use.

5. It has a game blocking feature where those games that are good candidates of banner bricking are automatically rejected by the program.

6. You can install created channels directly using network. Or you can create installer executables for both wii side and windows.
